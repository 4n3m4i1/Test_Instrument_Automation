# Test_Instrument_Automation
USB &lt;-> RS232/GPIB, but not $300 :p

Older test instruments are a reasonable way to build up a lab for personal or organizational use. Unfortunately GPIB (IEEE-488) is not reasonable, if only for the cost of cables (maybe I'm just unlucky, idk) and the absurd cost of USB-GPIB bridges. RS232 is a far better option, however due to the inability to daisy chain non-addressable instruments multiple USB-RS232 bridges will take most of your USB ports, or require a USB hub.  
  
The hardware and software contained here are aimed at consolidating several interfaces into a single device, which with just a single USB interface can bridge the gap between you and a pile of 80s/90s test equipment.
